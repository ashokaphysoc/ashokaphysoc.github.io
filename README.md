#### Local setup

If you don't have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) installed on your system, install them first. [Fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) this repository to `github.com:<your-username>/<your-repo-name>` and do the following:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
$ cd <your-repo-name>
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```
Now, feel free to customize the theme however you like (don't forget to change the name!).
After you are done, **commit** your final changes.

This theme is based on the [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) theme.
